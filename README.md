# AI Harmony Generation (CS4100 F2025)

## Overview
Our project's purpose was to develop an AI System capable of generating harmonies to complement a provided melody. In order to accomplish this purpose, we collected ~7000 MIDI files containing piano and violin mono-melodies in order to develop a Hidden Markov Model that would capture note patterns, piano-violin note relationships, and more. We then applied the Viterbi algorithm for decoding a piano note sequence to accompany a violin sequence provided as input. For generation (TO BE CONTINUED)...
